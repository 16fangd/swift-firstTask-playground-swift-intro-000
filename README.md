## Learning Objectives

* Create variables and constants using `let` and `var`.
* Use the `print()` function to print their `String` types to the console.
* Create variables of type `String` and `Int`.
* Create variables using *type inference* and *type annotations*.
* Use *string interpolation* to print out `String` literals to the console.

## Instructions

This is your first lab. Some labs require that you open up Xcode, other labs ask that you open up the playground file. What does that mean?

If you aren't familiar with Xcode, I suggest reading [this](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/reading-ios-intro-to-xcode). If you aren't familiar with how tests work and what your interaction will be with them, read [this](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-xcode-warnings-errors) next.

This lab is aking that you open up a playground file, so I will walk you through those steps. The playground file has _no_ tests in it.

First things first, you should clone down this repository. If you aren't familiar with how to do that or the process of submitting labs, you should read [this](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-functionFun-lab/tree/master).

After cloning down this project, you should locate the directory in Terminal or locating it through finder.

Example of locating the directory in Finder:

Open up the `MyPlayground.playground` file. After doing so, you should see the following:

If you see something like this instead, then you need to make sure Render Documentation is checked.

You can check off the Render Documentation by opening up the Utilities pane (top right box thing) and then check it off like so:

Here's how you should be answering these various questions. I like to delete where it states

```swift
// write your code here
```

Then replace that section with what you think the answer is.. like so:

After completing all of the questions, you will want to now go back to terminal to git add, commit and push up your changes. After doing so, you should submit in a pull request through Github. After doing so, you've now completed the lab!
