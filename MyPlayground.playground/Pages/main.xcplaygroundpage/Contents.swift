 In the following questions, where we use the term `variable`, we are not specifying whether or not it's a variable that is declared with `var` or a constant which is declared with `let`. We are using this general term, leaving it up to you to decipher whether or not you need to use `var` or `let` within the solution.

 ### 1. Create a variable which represents your bank account. (What you should be thinking.. What is a good name for this variable that makes it easily readable for myself now and for the future me OR other developers I might be working with? Should I declare it using let or var? Should it be of type Int or String?
